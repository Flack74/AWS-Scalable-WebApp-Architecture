# AWS-Scalable-WebApp-Architecture

A scalable, fault-tolerant, and cloud-native web application architecture built on **AWS**, leveraging key services like **Elastic Beanstalk**, **RDS**, **CloudFront**, **ElastiCache**, **RabbitMQ**, and more.  
This project demonstrates best practices for designing and deploying highly available applications with CI/CD, observability, and automation in mind.

## ðŸš€ Architecture Overview

This architecture uses the following core AWS services:

- **Amazon Route 53** â€“ DNS and domain routing
- **Amazon CloudFront** â€“ Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** â€“ Scalable and secure traffic distribution
- **Elastic Beanstalk** â€“ Application orchestration and auto-scaling
- **Amazon RDS** â€“ Managed relational database service (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- **Amazon ElastiCache** â€“ In-memory caching layer (e.g., Redis or Memcached)
- **Amazon MQ (RabbitMQ)** â€“ Messaging and queueing
- **Amazon OpenSearch** â€“ Search and log aggregation
- **Amazon CloudWatch** â€“ Monitoring, logging, and alerts
- **Amazon S3** â€“ Storage for static assets and artifacts

---

## ðŸš€ Deployment Options

Deploy this stack on AWS using:

- **Elastic Beanstalk** â€“ Fully managed application platform
- **Ansible** â€“ Automated infrastructure provisioning
- **Jenkins** â€“ Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

## ðŸ§  Credits

Inspired by the architecture used in the [vprofile app](https://github.com/devopshydclub/vprofile-project), this project is expanded to support a broader range of frameworks and languages in a modular, scalable AWS infrastructure.
